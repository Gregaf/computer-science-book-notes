## Interviewing Process Qualities
The following metrics are typically used to assess during an interview:
- **Analytical Skills**: 
	- How optimal was your solution? 
	- Did you struggle?
	- How well thought was your optimization
- **Coding Skills**: 
	- Could you translate your theoretical algorithm to code reasonably?
	- Did it follow coding best practices? e.g. variable naming
	- Did you handle edge cases?
- **Technical Knowledge/C.S Fundamentals**:
	- Do you have a strong foundation in computer science
- **Experience**:
	- Have you made solid technical decision in the past?
	- Have you shown drive and initiative?
- **Culture Fit/Communication**: 
	- Does your personality fit the company?

Knowledge of basic data structures and their application is an important fact when being tested.

### White boarding
- It is normal to not have 100% error free code, but that does not mean it is okay to write pseudo code, the details matter.
- Focus on the algorithm and what will be implemented

### Question Grade/Selection
- Grading typically is handled relative to other candidates. So this is not a fixed evaluation.
- Interviewers tend to be in charge of the questions asked? 
- Some companies will prefer knowledge based vs algorithmic questions.
